# expression-trees

## About
This program gets a postfix expression from the user along with the userâ€™s choice on whether to convert to prefix or infix. The program then builds an expression tree representing the expression and uses that expression tree to complete the desired conversion. It also prints the evaluation of the original expression (by using the expression tree).
